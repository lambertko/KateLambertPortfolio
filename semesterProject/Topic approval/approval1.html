                <li>The <b>purpose of this website</b> is to host useful information regarding creating art with clay. This includes learning how to make sculptures on the pottery wheel, hand-building, how to correctly use glazes, and the process of firing ceramic pieces in the kiln.  </li>

                <li>I want this <b>website to accomplish</b> multiple things: hopefully inspire people to start working with clay, introduce the viewers to some of my favorite ceramic artists/artworks, and also provide accurate information so this website wil be useful. </li>

                <li>The <b>intended audience</b> I want this website to reach are people who have been searching for a new artform to learn. Also this is for people who have been interested in the work of ceramics but don't know the specifics of how to start.</li>

                <li>The content that will be included on this website will be informational paragraphs, videos, images, also links to other websites/videos and social media accounts including additional information. There will be a navigation bar to get from one page to another. </li>

                <li>My <b>website will be unique</b> becasue I am going to try to combine all of the information to help someone actually get started with creating ceramics, I will include what tools, materials, and even what work space they should have. I will also try to find the cheapest tools and materials to link so that this is a realistic beginner website.  </li>
