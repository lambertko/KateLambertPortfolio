            <h2>Website goals:</h2>
             <p>I want this website to host useful information regarding creating art with clay. This includes learning how to make sculptures on the pottery wheel, hand-building, how to correctly use glazes, and the process of firing ceramic pieces in the kiln.</p>
            <p>Another goal I have for this website is to inspire people to start working with clay, introduce the viewers to some of my favorite ceramic artists/artworks, and also provide accurate information so this website wil be useful.</p>

            <h2>Information and Resources:</h2>
            <p>For my content, I will need to explain the steps for throwing on the wheel in depth. Inform the viewer about the process of glazing and firing the piece in the kiln. </p>
            <p>I will include videos and pictures from youtube and the internet for reference and to help the viewer understand fully. I will also include multiple social media accounts and my favorite ceramic artists to inspire the viewer. </p>
            <p> I will also have a section that will list all of the tools and materials needed to start making art with clay. I will try to find materials with the cheapest prices so that this is realistic.  </p>
