        <p>Hi! My name is Kate Lambert and one of my favorite hobbies/passions is 
            ceramics. I learned how to make pottery in highschool and I did it for three years. Recently I have not been able to practice it just becasue of the price and I am a college student. It is definitely something I will take up after college. 
            <br>
            I hope this website helps you learn something about ceramics and maybe even inspires you to take up the hobby.
            <br>
            If you have any questions or commennts that I have not answered please email me <a href="mailto:lambertko@g.cofc.edu">here</a>
