While his mother is from Guyana, his father has his heritage in Sierra Leone. Hynes was raised in what he describes as a loving family with very personal communication with his parents. Something he perceives as cultural. Both of his parents had full-time jobs; her father was a manager in a Marks &amp; Spencer department store and her mother a health care consultant, advising mainly teenage mothers.</p>

        <p>     Dev Hynes is the latest in his family of 5 which includes two siblings who are 5 and 7 years older than him. Due to the big age difference, Hynes had a rather lonely childhood and was alone in his room, listening to British soul music (his mother&#8217;s favorite) most of the time, as well as songs from Nirvana and Bone. Thugs-n-Harmony belonging to his siblings.</p>

        <p>     This early exposure to music awakened his passion, he had moved to London at the age of 18 and was beginning to make music. He attended Chadwell Heath Foundation School, a school which has since changed its name to Chadwell Heath Academy.</p>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul class="facts">
            <li>If Dev Hynes had never met Solange, he probably would have ended up becoming a footballer, a career he really thinks is worth pursuing. Growing up in Essex, Hynes played football and was part of Dagenham &amp; Redbridge football club. He played at the level where Charlton Athletic scouts began to watch him, but, due to his dislike of Essex, Hynes gave up football for music. However, he continues to play as a hobby at least twice a week. Apart from football, Dev Hynes is also good at basketball and table tennis.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Over two days in June 2020, Hynes raised over half a million dollars for the Movement For Black Lives and the LGBTQ Freedom Fund by selling a T-shirt designed with the brand Brain Dead. The text on the T-shirt read “If You Love Black Culture Protect Black Lives,” which he intended as a critique of non-Black artists who mined the culture without stepping into the Black Lives Matter protests.

        <h2>About his Genre</h2>
        <p>Dev Hynes’ world, as it has been revealed to his fans, is a multi-textural one. The Blood Orange sound, which is often tender and melodically rich, is inspired by music played around Hynes’ household, ranging from his father’s appreciation for classical to his mother’s love for UK soul like Sade and UB-40. He’d hear his sister play Nirvana and Blur through his bedroom wall while his brother was a fan of hip-hop. Around the same time that he fell in love with Paul’s Boutique, he was beginning to formulate his own taste, becoming obsessed with British guitar bands like Mansun, Ash and The Bluetones while also morphing into a metalhead. As an artist whose back catalogue ranges from the adolescent screamo of his first band Test Icicles to the eloquent indie-folk of Lightspeed Champion, it’s no wonder that his musical education was so diverse.</p>
